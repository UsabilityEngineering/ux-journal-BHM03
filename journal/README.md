Calorie Counter UX

  Over the past few weeks, I’ve been thinking about taking my training more seriously. My first step was to find an app that will allow me to easily track my protein intake and calories. I came across an app called MacrosFirst that caught my attention due to its barcode scanner feature. This will effectively identify the grams of protein and calories in each food product I consume.
  
  After downloading the app, I was greeted by a login/sign in page. This is a standard step in apps, so I easily navigated through this process. I briefly glanced at the homepage and knew exactly what button to press. It was a barcode icon near the bottom of the screen (1). From a mental model perspective, the app has implemented its most useful feature effectively. A mentally model describes the user’s next action that is based on their own past experiences. Next, my camera appeared which I used to scan various items in my pantry and fridge (2). 
  
  Finally, the app correctly recognized each item’s protein, kcal, fat, and carbs. All information was stored within the “Foods” section (3). This app made it incredibly easy to track my macros and is simple enough for any user to navigate through the UI.
